# puphpet-release

Makes an unpacked version of the vagrant environment generated by puphpet.com available via composer and Packagist.

This repo represents a snapshot of the PuPHPet project. It includes minimal tooling designed to fetch a copy of the PuPHPet release ZIP file and import it back into this project. This project includes a composer.json file, making it possible to include puphpet in another target project using composer.

There are a still a number of things that could stand to improve. For those, see:

* https://github.com/puphpet/puphpet/issues/1320
* https://github.com/loadsys/puphpet-release/issues/1


## :warning: Big Important Warning :warning:

This package uses a composer custom installer that does very non-standard, typically bad, things, including overwriting files in your project outside of the `vendor/` directory.

This is something that composer [very explicitly](https://github.com/composer/installers#should-we-allow-dynamic-package-types-or-paths-no) says we **should not be doing.** We break this very good and wise rule only because the tools we're working with (vagrant and puphpet) leave us with no other practical choice.

:exclamation: **Using this package will cause any root level `/Vagrantfile` and `/puphpet/` folder in your existing project to be unceremoniously overwritten without notice, and a `/.gitignore` to be created or modified.** Do not complain about this. This is what this package is designed to do and you've been duly warned of its danger.


## Requirements

* [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* A project of your own in which you'd like to use PuPHPet via composer.


## Installation

Run the following command to include the vagrant environment provided by PuPHPet in your project:

```shell
php composer.phar require --dev loadsys/puphpet-release:1.0.*
```


## Usage

Once you've included the package as instructed above, you should be able to run vagrant with the default configuration immediately:

```shell
vagrant up
```

### Customizing

To customize the vagrant box, you have two choices:

* Copy the default `/puphpet/config.yaml` file provided to `/puphpet.yaml` and edit it to suit your needs. When an existing `/puphpet.yaml` file is found in your project, it will be copied to `/puphpet/config.yaml` for this package to use.

or

* You can generate an appropriate `config.yaml` file using the puphpet.com web interface. Once you download the resulting `puphpet.zip` file, take **just** the `puphpet/config.yaml` file and save it into your project as `puphpet.yaml`.

In either case, your `puphpet.yaml` file should be committed to your own project's source control system so the vagrant virtual machine remains identical for all developers on the project.


@TODO: What about `files/` and `exec-*` scripts?


### Running the release scraper

This project includes a shell script designed to fetch the latest puphpet.zip file from puphpet.com, unpack it, and commit it back into this repo.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:loadsys/puphpet-release.git
cd puphpet-release
bin/scrape-release.sh
```

This script is intended be scheduled to run via cron to update the repo periodically. It must be run from a clone of the remote repo that Packagist is aware of and that has ssh permission to push back to the remote repository.

Packagist expects semantic versioning, and this presents a challenge. The puphpet.com project [does not conform to semver](https://github.com/puphpet/puphpet/issues/777#issuecomment-51832044) and the project makes backwards-incompatible changes frequently. To work around this, the release script automatically tags each new version using a minor number. This allows consuming projects to target a specific point release that will never auto-update in a breaking way.

The consequence is that consuming projects **must** manually update their targeted version and verify it is still operational for their needs (as well as check that their `puphpet.yaml` file is up to date.)
